   <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

      <p>
        I’m excited to apply for a data-oriented role that blends SQL mastery, resilient troubleshooting, and collaborative development. With years of hands-on experience across database environments, CRM systems, and modular infrastructure, I bring a pragmatic mindset and a passion for turning messy data into meaningful insight.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve led initiatives involving 150+ SQL databases, optimizing schema performance, writing complex joins, and transforming raw tables into actionable reports. My toolkit includes SSIS, Python, and PowerShell for ETL automation, and while I’ve yet to work in Alteryx, I’m confident my experience with low-code data orchestration tools will make learning it seamless.
      </p>

      <p>
        In previous roles, I’ve investigated data integrity issues across audited platforms, collaborated closely with agile teams via Jira, and maintained clean, teachable documentation that accelerates onboarding and promotes transparency. I’m especially driven by high-availability environments where accuracy and accountability aren’t just goals—they’re necessities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond technical expertise, I’m entrepreneurial and systems-minded, recently founding Code Storm Technologies to explore resilient, self-hosted architectures that empower users to recover and build with confidence. I believe that thoughtful data stewardship and ethical infrastructure can unlock better decisions and stronger teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’d be honored to contribute my skill set to a forward-thinking organization with a strong data foundation. I welcome the opportunity to connect and explore how we can build clarity, reliability, and trust—one query at a time.
      </p>

      <p>Warm regards,<br />

    Joseph W.P. Bodden Jr.<br>
