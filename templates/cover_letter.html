    <p><strong>To whom it may concern,</strong></p>

    <p>With over a decade of experience in application support, systems integration, and data analytics, I bring a results-driven mindset rooted <br>
      in strong technical expertise and a proven commitment to resilient, scalable infrastructure. My PCEP™ Python certification and hands-on mastery of <br> 
      SQL Server environments reflect a foundation built not just on knowledge—but on delivering mission-critical solutions in fast-paced environments.</p>

    <p>In my recent role as Integration Support Analyst at Vistage Worldwide, I led root-cause analysis using advanced T-SQL, Splunk, and Jira while <br> 
      developing automated reporting with SSRS to streamline operations and empower key stakeholders. My work in containerized deployments and Python automation<br> 
      exemplifies a DevOps-centric approach that values performance, precision, and long-term system integrity.</p>

    <p>I’m drawn to companies that blend innovation with legacy and sustainable impact. I believe technology should drive meaningful outcomes, and I strive to contribute <br> 
      where systems not only evolve but do so with purpose and accountability.</p>

    <p>I’d welcome the opportunity to bring my technical fluency, diagnostic rigor, and collaborative energy to your team. Whether it's architecting high-availability SQL Server clusters<br> 
      or mentoring peers through complex troubleshooting, I’m ready to make an enduring contribution.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration—I look forward to the chance to connect.</p>

    <p>Warm regards,<br>
    Joseph W.P. Bodden Jr.<br>
